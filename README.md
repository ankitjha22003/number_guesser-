Logic of Number Guesser Game

Start the game

The program begins running.

Generate a random number

The computer selects a random number within a fixed range (for example, 1 to 100).

This number is hidden from the user.

Ask the user to guess

The user is prompted to enter a number as their guess.

Compare the guess with the random number

If the guessed number is greater than the random number:

The program tells the user: “Too High”.

If the guessed number is smaller than the random number:

The program tells the user: “Too Low”.

If the guessed number is equal to the random number:

The program tells the user: “Congratulations! You guessed the correct number.”

Repeat until correct

Steps 3 and 4 repeat in a loop until the user guesses the correct number.

End the game

Once the correct number is guessed, the game stops.

🔁 Key Programming Concepts Used
